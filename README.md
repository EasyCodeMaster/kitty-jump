To play the game, first open the code file in MARS, and go to ***Tools - Bitmap Display***. Set the configuration as follows:

- Unit width in pixels: 8        		     
- Unit height in pixels: 8
- Display width in pixels: 256
- Display height in pixels: 512
- Base Address for Display: 0x10008000 ($gp)

Resize the window to fit the bitmap display. Click on ***Connet to MIPS***.

Then go to ***Tools - Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulater***. Again, click on ***Connet to MIPS***.

on the toolbar to assemble the program 
 and then click on <img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77775845/105328867-80468e00-5b9e-11eb-8a9c-3981acb516d4.jpg width = "30" alt = "MARS-run-icon">
to run it. 

**Congratulations! You are now all set!**
