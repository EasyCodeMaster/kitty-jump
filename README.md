- Unit height in pixels:     8
- Display width in pixels: &emsp;&ensp;&ensp;256
- Display height in pixels: &emsp;	512
- Base Address for Display: 	0x10008000 ($gp)

Resize the window to fit the bitmap display.
Click on ***Connet to MIPS***.

Then go to ***Tools - Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulater***.
